# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
My program is a short quiz game that gets a temp on the users current mood and sends either a personalized quote (if the user is sad)
or joke (if the user is happy) to brighten their day.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
None.

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
I used the websites of the API's used to figure out the parameters used, as well as how to import them into my program. I also used websites like StackOverflow on Google to help me debug my code.
To get a better idea of how to use API's (as I missed the class that went over them), I watched a few Youtube videos.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
None.
